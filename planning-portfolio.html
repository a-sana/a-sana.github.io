        <p><a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/swiss-cal-virtual-conference" target="_blank"><img src="images/swisscal.png"></a><small><small>I helped with facilitating the SwissCal Conference on the Swiss Public Transportation Ecosystem. I wrote three reports; one for SCAG, which you can view <a href="https://scag.ca.gov/post/swisscal-conference-swiss-public-transportation-ecosystem">here</a>; one for LA Metro (not available to the public); and one for the general Bay Area region (also not available to the public). There were six sessions total, held on different days; the first three were the main sessions, and the final three were region-specific workshops. In addition to the reports, I authored three blog posts for the main sessions, which you can view <a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/blog/2022/2/21/one-journey-one-ticket-summary-of-day-1-of-the-swisscal-conference">here</a>, <a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/blog/2022/2/21/a-seamless-customer-experience-and-a-cooperation-based-model-of-public-transport-summary-of-day-2-of-the-swisscal-conference">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/blog/2022/3/17/t9qwyb2xlez9zblfyaj79ny3azaahf">here</a>; I also regularly updated and maintained the <a href="https://www.seamlessbayarea.org/swiss-cal-virtual-conference">conference website</a>. Additionally, the blog posts are referenced <a href="https://west.stanford.edu/news/swiss-have-mastered-public-transit-what-might-california-learn-their-success">here</a> in an article by Kylie Gordon of the Bill Lane Center for the American West at Stanford University. </small></small></p>
        <p><a href="files/SanaAhmed_SampleWork1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="images/s1.png"></a><small><small>I used a GPS to note all locations where I encountered different art pieces. I then categorized the types of art that I found. I created this map using ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator for my Cartography class at UC Berkeley.</small></small></p>
       <p><a href="files/SanaAhmed_SampleWork2.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/s2.png"></a><small><small>For my Urban Design course at UC Berkeley, we studied Hayes Valley. Here I capture different elements of the landscape.</small></small></p>
        <p><a href="files/SanaAhmed_SampleWork3.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/s3.png"></a><small><small>This is one of several maps I created using ArcGIS and Adobe Illustrator for the Mayor's Office on Disability while I was a Student Design Trainee in the Curb Ramp Program at San Francisco Public Works.</small></small></p>
       <p> <a href="files/SanaAhmed_SampleWork4.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/s4.png"></a><small><small>For my Urban Planning Studio course, I analyzed census data to determine the highest concentration of Latine individuals in San Mateo County. I created the maps by hand using Adobe Illustrator and created the layout in Adobe InDesign. </small></small> </p>
       <p><a href="files/SanaAhmed_SampleWork5.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/s5.png"></a><small><small>For my Urban Planning Studio course, we worked with a group of mothers advocating to improve their community in San Jose. I helped them outline immediate and short-term goals.</small></small></p>
       <p><a href="https://bit.ly/3QGwFcR" target="_blank"><img src="images/s6.png"></a><small><small>For my Geographic Information Systems (GIS) course, my group and I conducted a suitability analysis to determine the best location for a new skatepark in San Francisco. I helped gather and organize and gather the data and conduct the data analysis to create the maps.</small></small></p>
